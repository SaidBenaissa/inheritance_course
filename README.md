`In this example, we have a Person class that has a constructor to initialize the firstName and lastName properties and a getFullName method to return the full name of the person.

We then have an Employee class that inherits from the Person class using the public access specifier. This means that all the public and protected members of the Person class will be accessible in the Employee class.

The Employee class has a constructor that takes three arguments, including the firstName and lastName arguments that are passed to the constructor of the parent class using the initialization list syntax, and the position argument that is used to initialize the position property. The Employee class also has a getPosition method that returns the position of the employee.`
